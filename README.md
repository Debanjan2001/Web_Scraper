***Download all libraries mentioned in requirements.txt and proceed***

To run this code on your system, download job_scraper.py and create a folder named "posts" in the same location. When you will run the python file, it will 
automatically save the jobs with some description and links in the text files inside the folder.

You can also import this as a module in any python based applications and use the find_jobs function by modifying it as per your convenience.
